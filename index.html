				<h2>Why <span class="text-red">study</span> Business Analyst</h2>

				<p>Today, the role of a business analyst is vital in powering any successful digital business. Bringing broad and enduring value, business analysts translate business needs into the right buildable solutions and processes.</p>
				<p>Our Business Analyst course will provide you an immersed experience in
				responding to an in-depth scenario that follows each stage of the business
				analysis lifecycle. You’ll learn the key transferable skills required by a
				valuable business analyst which are causation, facilitation, problem solving,
				work breakdown, and adaptive communication.</p>
				<p>Importantly, you’ll gain universal technical skills in requirements gathering,
				process mapping, and user story writing. Simulating common real-life
				situations that require problem-solving, you’ll also learn how to update
				process maps based on changed requirements and review non-functional
				requirements. By the end of this course, you’ll present your findings through
				a stakeholder presentation and video for your final, scenario-based project.</p>

				<p class="text-summary" id="reasons-summary-1">According to a 2018 survey by <span class="text-red">ZDNet</span>,
				70% of organisations undertaking digital
				transformations are driving an increased
				need for business analysts, with growth
				expected to increase by 20% over the next
				five years.</p>
